# Unbeatable TicTacToe - The frustrating AI

## Why is it unbeatable?

Tic Tac Toe is a mecanical game. You can teach an *AI* to always win or draw. Here is a small explanation.

First of all, it's not artificial intelligence. There are a couple of rules that make sure that you always win or draw (or in this case, that the AI wins or draws):

1. If AI begins, it takes a random corner.
2. If the player begins with a corner, AI takes the center. If not, AI takes a corner.
3. Check for player doublets (dangerous doublets) and fill the holes to avoid loosing.
4. If AI has a corner, AI tries to take another corner.
5. Play randomnly.

So next time you play with a friend, try these simple rules. You'll be unbeatable as well.

Remember that loosing at Tic Tac Toe is linked with lack of attention. And maybe you can inattentive, but a program cannot.
