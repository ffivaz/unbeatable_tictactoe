Unbeatable TicTacToe - The frustrating AI

## Why is it unbeatable?

Tic Tac Toe is a mecanical game. You can teach an *AI* to always win or draw. Here is a small explanation.

First of all, it's not artificial intelligence. There are a couple of rules that make sure that the *AI* always wins or draws:

-If AI begins, it takes a random corner.
-If the player begins with a corner, AI takes the center. If not, AI takes a corner.
-If AI has a corner, whatever player does, AI takes another corner.
-Check for player doublets (dangerous doublets) and fill the holes to avoid loosing.
-Play randomnly.

So next time you play with a friend, try these simple rules. You'll be unbeatable as well.
